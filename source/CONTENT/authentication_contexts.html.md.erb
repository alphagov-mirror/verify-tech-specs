#Authentication Contexts

##Abstract

This specification defines the SAML authentication contexts to be used
in conjunction with the Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile v1.2.

##Introduction

The Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile describes how
service providers offering online government services can use any number
of Hub Services for the brokering of a citizen authentication and
enrichment of citizen attributes.

This document describes the authentication contexts to be used in
conjunction with the Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile.

###Notation

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in
IETF RFC 2119 \[RFC 2119\].

##Authentication Contexts

This document describes the authentication contexts specified for use
with the IDA hub service profile.

When requesting authentication for an individual or responding to that
request the level of assurance requested (or attained) must be
specified. The IDA hub service profile conforms to the definitions of
level of assurance as described in *GPG 45 -- Identity Proofing and
Verification of an Individual*.

This document describes how level of assurance is specified and recorded
in interactions between the hub services, identity providers and service
providers. An additional authentication context is included for the
purpose of reporting fraud as detected by an identity provider, Level X.

###Specifying Level of Assurance in <AuthnRequest>

Service providers and the hub service will construct a
<RequestedAuthnContext> within the <AuthnRequest> that describes the
level of assurance required to enable the principal to transact with the
service.

An example <RequestedAuthnContext> can be seen below (in this case a
request for a LoA of 1 as a minimum, LoA2 preferred).

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/requested_authn_context' -%>

###Returning Level of Assurance in <Response>

The <Assertion> returned in the <Response> to the hub service MUST
include an <AuthnStatement> which includes the level of assurance to
which the principal has been authenticated.

An example <AuthnStatement> can be seen below (in this case level of
assurance is LoA2).

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/authn_statement' -%>

###Authentication Context values for Level of Assurance

The schemas defined in section 2.3.1 onwards denote authentication
contexts matching the levels of assurance described in *GPG 45 --
Identity Proofing and Verification of an Individual*. These
authentication contexts are to be used by service providers and the hub
service when requesting authentication at a specific level of assurance,
and by identity providers when responding to an authentication request.

###Level 1 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_1' -%>

###Level 2 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_2' -%>

###Level 3 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_3' -%>

###Level 4 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_4' -%>

###Level X Authentication Context (Fraud Event)

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/fraud_event' -%>

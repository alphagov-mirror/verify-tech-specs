# eIDAS outbound

This document describes how the UK Proxy Node can use a service, as
defined in the Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile, to
broker citizen authentication for use with eIDAS. This profile describes
the interactions between the proxy node and the hub service.

## UK Proxy Node

Communication between the UK's eIDAS Proxy Service Node and the GOV.UK
Verify Hub is a variation on the behaviour defined within the Identity
Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile section 2.1.2.

In this profile, the UK's eIDAS Proxy Service Node takes the role of a
proxy node, the GOV.UK Verify Hub takes the role of the hub service, and
a Member State Connector Node taks the role of the connector node.

The proxy node is treated as a specialised service provider that is
connected to the hub service. When communicating with the proxy node in
this flow, the hub service doesn't attempt to interact with any matching
services. When issuing a Response to the proxy node as a result of a
successful verification the hub service will include the Assertion
elements received from the identity provider's Response.

##Message flow

The following profile steps document the authentication and message flow
of this profile and should be compared with the full authentication flow
described in section 2.1 of the Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0
Profile.

###1. AuthnRequest issued by Connector Node to Proxy Node

In step 1, an AuthnRequest message is delivered to the proxy node's
single sign-on service location by the user agent.

This message must be structured according to the eIDAS SAML Profile.

###2. AuthnRequest issued by Proxy Node to Hub Service

In step 2, an AuthnRequest message is delivered to the hub service's
single sign-on service by the user agent

The AuthnRequest message must be signed.

###3. AuthnRequest issued by Hub Service to the Identity Provider

In step 3, the hub service will follow the steps defined between
sections 2.1.3.3 and 2.1.3.6 of the IDA SAML Profile where the user
selects an identity provider before issuing a AuthnRequest message
deliver via the user agent to the selected identity provider.

###4. Response issued by Identity Provider to the Hub Service

In step 4, the identity provider will follow the steps defined between
sections 2.1.3.7 and 2.1.3.8 of the IDA SAML Profile. The identity
provider will verify a user's identity before issuing a Response message
delivered via the user agent to the hub service.

###5. Hub Service issues Response to Proxy Node

In step 5, the hub service issues a Response message delivered by the
user agent to the proxy node.

The Response must contain all identity provider Assertion elements or an
error in the form of a status code (and any relevant sub-status code).

All Assertion elements must include the original signature from the
identity provider. The Assertion elements must be encrypted for the
proxy node.

The Response must not include any Assertion elements if the user did not
successfully authenticate at the required level of assurance.

The Response element must be signed. To ensure that the assertion is for
the proxy node, the Assertion must also be encrypted by the hub service
using the proxy node's encryption public key.

###6. Proxy Node issues Response to Connector Node

In step 6, The proxy node issues a Response as a message delivered by
the user agent to the connector node.

The proxy node must validate and transform the Response from the hub
service to generate the issued Response. The identity provider
assertions contained in the Response MUST be transformed to produce a
single assertion in the issued Response.

The Response and Assertion elements must conform to the format required
by the eIDAS Profile.

The Assertion elements MUST be signed by the proxy node. The signed
Assertion elements MUST be encrypted by the proxy node using the MS
Connector Node's encryption public key. The Response MUST be signed by
the proxy node.

The Response must contain the transformed Assertion element or an error
in the form of a status code (and any relevant sub-status code).

The Response must not include any Assertion elements if the user did not
successfully authenticate at the required level of assurance.

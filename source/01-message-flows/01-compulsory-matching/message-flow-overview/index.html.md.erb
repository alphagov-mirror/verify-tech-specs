# Message flow diagram

Figure 1 below illustrates the authenticating of a principal using a hub
service. Each step in the figure is described by this profile.

**Figure needed - Authentication Flow**

## Profile Description

In this profile the hub service has two distinct roles. When processing
authentication requests from a service provider the hub service acts as
an identity provider. When sending authentication requests to identity
providers the hub service acts as a relying party.

In the descriptions below the following are referred to:

**Single Sign-On Service**

This is the authentication request protocol endpoint at the identity
provider and at a hub service to which the `<AuthnRequest>` message is
delivered by the user agent.

**Assertion Consumer Service**

This is the authentication request protocol endpoint at the service
provider and at a hub service to which the `<Response>` message is
delivered by the user agent.

**Attribute Query Service**

This is the attribute query protocol endpoint at the service provider
to which the `<AttributeQuery>` message is sent by the hub service.

**Asserting Entity**

This is a hub service (when acting as an IdP with respect to a SP), an
identity provider, or a service provider that can issue a SAML
assertion or an asserted attribute.

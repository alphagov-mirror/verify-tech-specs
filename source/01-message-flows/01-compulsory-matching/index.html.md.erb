# Compulsory matching

This hub service profile is defined to support federated authentication
to government services and the future support of single sign-on (SSO).
The current profile is based on the [SAML Web Browser SSO Profile](LINK).

This version of the profile is a reflection of the current IDAP Hub
Service and is simplified from version 1.0 removing elements not
currently required for government services. Features that have been
removed from the profile may be reintroduced in future versions as
requirements evolve.

## Web Browser SSO Profile

In the scenario supported by the Hub Service profile a principal
attempts to access a resource at a service provider that requires a
security context. The principal is authenticated by an identity
provider, which provides an assertion to the Hub Service. The hub
service forwards the assertion to the service provider. The service
provider may then establish a security context for the principal

The Single Logout Profile is not supported by this profile. On
redirection to the hub service following a successful authentication
Identity Providers MUST close any authentication session that has been
created (LINK 2.1.3.8).

This profile is implemented using the SAML Authentication Request
protocol and the SAML Attribute Query protocol. It uses several of the
existing SAML profiles, namely the Web SSO Profile and Assertion
Query/Request Profile. It is assumed that the principal is using a
standard commercial browser and can authenticate to the identity
provider by some means outside the scope of SAML.

By default all user agent exchanges MUST utilise TLS 1.2 or higher.
Message integrity and confidentiality will be maintained through the use
of asymmetric key signing and encryption.

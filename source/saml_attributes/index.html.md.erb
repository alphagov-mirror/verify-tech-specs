#SAML Attributes

##Abstract

>` This specification defines a profile for the use of SAML assertions
>` and request-response messages to be used between participants in the
>` Identity Assurance federation architecture.


##Introduction

The Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile describes how
service providers offering online government services can use any number
of Hub Services for the brokering of a citizen authentication and
enrichment of citizen attributes.

This document describes the SAML Attributes to be used in conjunction
with the Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile.

###Notation

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in
IETF RFC 2119 \[RFC 2119\].

##SAML Attributes 

This section details the Matching Dataset attributes and mandatory
attributes supported by this profile for the expressing of data related
to the SAML assertion subject.

### Required Information

**Identification:**
http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/ida/attributes (this
corresponds to the target namespace specified in the schema in section
2.4)

###SAML Attribute Naming

The NameFormat XML attribute in `<Attribute>` elements MUST be
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified` unless otherwise
specified in the schema.

The XML attribute Name value MUST be one of the descriptors defined in
section 2.4.

The optional XML attribute FriendlyName value, if present, MUST be one
of the friendly descriptors associated with the Name descriptor.
Examples are included later in this document for clarity.

###Attribute Name Comparison

`<Attribute>` elements refer to the same SAML attribute if and only if
the Name XML attribute values are equal.

###Profile-Specific XML Attributes

This following profile-specific XML attributes MAY be specified for an
`<AttributeValue>` element as specified in the schema in section 2.4:

-   `From`, a date constructed in accordance with the W3C Date and Time
    Formats Specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.
-\   `To`, a date constructed in accordance with the W3C Date and Time
    Formats Specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
-   `Language`, represents natural language identifiers as defined by
    [RFC 3066] with a default of "en-GB".
-   `Order`, represents the order in which an `<AttributeValue>` element
    MUST be processed when multiple attribute values exist for and
    `<Attribute>`. Starting at 1 with increments of 1.
-   `Verified`, denotes an `<AttributeValue>` as being verified or not in
    accordance with GPG45.

## SAML Attribute Values

The schema type of the contents of the `<AttributeValue>` element MUST
be drawn from one of the types specified below.

The xsi:type attribute MUST be present and be given the appropriate value.

The following schema defines the XML attributes and complex types
supported by this profile:

<%= xsd 'saml_attributes/attributes' -%>

##Matching Dataset Attribute Definitions

### Firstname

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's first name and any
historic values for the subject's first name as known to the asserting
entity.

**Name:** MDS_firstname

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing a PersonNameType
as specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/firstname' -%>

Fig, 2.5.1.1 Firstname provided without attribute history

Attribute values describing history of Firstname should be identified by
the inclusion of the profile specific From and To attributes as can be
seen in the following example.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/first_name_with_history' -%>

Fig. 2.5.1.2 Firstname and history of Firstname

###Surname

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's surname and any
historic values for the subject's surname as known to the asserting
entity.

**Name:** MDS_surname

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing a PersonNameType
as specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

Attribute values describing history of Surname should be identified by
the inclusion of the profile specific From and To attributes.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/surname' -%>

###Middle Name(s)

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's middle name(s) and
any historic values for the subject's middle name(s) as known to the
asserting entity.

**Name:** MDS_middlename

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing a PersonNameType
as specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4. Where there
are multiple middle names for the individual these should be separated
by a space as shown in the example below.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/middlename' -%>

Attribute values describing history of Middle Name(s) should be
identified by the inclusion of the profile specific From and To
attributes.

###Date of Birth

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's date of birth and any
historic values for the subject's date of birth as known to the
asserting entity.

**Name:** MDS_dateofbirth

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing a DateType as
specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/date_of_birth' -%>

Attribute values describing history of date of birth should be
identified by the inclusion of the profile specific From and To
attributes.

###Gender

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's gender.

**Name:** MDS_gender

A single `<AttributeValue>` element containing a GenderType as specified
in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

**Note: In version 1.2 of the profile history of gender MUST NOT be sent
by an asserting entity**

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/gender' -%>

###Current Address

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's current address.

**Name:** MDS_currentaddress

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing an AddressType
as specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/current_address' -%>

Optionally the UPRN (Unique Property Reference Number) may also be
included in the subject's address details to uniquely identify the
address and therefore aid matching where a local data set also includes
UPRN. UPRNs are integers that can be up to 12 digits in length; they can
therefore be less than 12 digits long and do not require leading zeros. 

If a non-UK address is represented the `<InternationalPostCode>` element
MUST be used instead of the UK-centric `<PostCode>` element.

###Previous Address

This value represents the SAML assertion subject's previous address or
addresses as known to the asserting entity.

**Name:** MDS_previousaddress

One or more `<AttributeValue>` elements each containing an AddressType
as specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/previous_address' -%>

##Authentication Event Assertion Attribute Definitions

The Authentication Event Assertion, as described in the SAML Profile,
provides the IDA service with additional contextual information
regarding the authentication event to be used for transactional
monitoring purposes. In the case of version 1.2 of the SAML Profile this
contextual information is to be initially limited to IP Address (of the
user-agent used for authentication) and the level of assurance achieved
(as returned within the `<AuthnContext>`). Additional attribute
definitions will be added during the lifetime of this profile following
elaboration with Identity Providers and Service Providers.

###IPAddress

This value represents the IP Address as used by the user-agent when
authenticating the principal.

**Name:** TXN_IPaddress

The single `<AttributeValue>` element contains a IPAddressType as
specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/ip_address' -%>

###Fraud Event Contextual Information Assertion Attribute Definitions

The Fraud Event Contextual Information Assertion, as described in the
SAML Profile, provides the IDA service with additional contextual
information regarding a fraud event.

###GPG45Status

This value represents the resulting status of the GPG45 IPV process
where fraudulent activity has been identified by the identity provider.

**Name:** FECI_GPG45Status

The single `<AttributeValue>` element contains a GPG45StatusType as
specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

***Note that the latest values for the GPG45 status attribute value should be sourced
from the IPV Operations Manual the example below is indicative only.***

IDPs should return the "*SAML Response -- Fraud Warning Code*" in this
status field as specified in the IPV Operations Manual.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/gpg45_status' -%>

###IDPFraudEventID

This value represents the unique IDP specific fraud event reference
code.

**Name:** FECI_IDPFraudEventID

The single `<AttributeValue>` element contains a IDPFraudEventIDType as
specified in the profile-specific schema in section 2.4.

<%= xml 'saml_attributes/idp_fraud_event_id' -%>

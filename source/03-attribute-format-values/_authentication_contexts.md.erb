##Authentication Contexts

When requesting authentication for an individual or responding to that
request the level of assurance requested (or attained) must be
specified. The IDA hub service profile conforms to the definitions of
level of assurance as described in *GPG 45 -- Identity Proofing and
Verification of an Individual*.

This document describes how level of assurance is specified and recorded
in interactions between the hub services, identity providers and service
providers. An additional authentication context is included for the
purpose of reporting fraud as detected by an identity provider, Level X.

###Returning Level of Assurance in \<Response\>

The `<Assertion>` returned in the `<Response>` to the hub service MUST
include an `<AuthnStatement>` which includes the level of assurance to
which the principal has been authenticated.

An example `<AuthnStatement>` can be seen below (in this case level of
assurance is LoA2).

###Authentication Context values for Level of Assurance

The schemas defined in section 2.3.1 onwards denote authentication
contexts matching the levels of assurance described in *GPG 45 --
Identity Proofing and Verification of an Individual*. These
authentication contexts are to be used by service providers and the hub
service when requesting authentication at a specific level of assurance,
and by identity providers when responding to an authentication request.

####Level 1 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_1' -%>

####Level 2 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_2' -%>

####Level 3 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_3' -%>

####Level 4 Authentication Context

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/level_4' -%>

####Level X Authentication Context (Fraud Event)

<%= xml 'authentication_contexts/fraud_event' -%>

##Name Identifiers

This section details the policy for use and creation of persistent
identifiers by the service provider matching services.

###Persistent Identifier

**URI:** `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML2.0:nameid-format:persistent`

This identifier is used between the hub and identity provider, and the
hub and service provider. It conforms to the \[SAMLCore\] specification
for persistent name identifiers.

The persistent identifier MUST be generated in conformance to
\[SAMLCore\] by the identity provider and included in the assertion for
a given principal. The identity provider SHOULD ensure that the
persistent identifier is valid for an extended period of time, e.g.
several months to avoid unnecessary re-matching occurring.

To ensure privacy of the principal is maintained across providers, the
persistent identifier stored for the same principal MUST be unique
between each of the following entities:
- Identity Provider
- Service Provider

In order to ensure uniqueness of the persistent identifier and to ensure
no identifiers are stored within the hub service, an algorithm will be
used for generation of the persistent identifier. This will be
implemented within every service provider (within the service provider
matching service.)

For a single principal, the identity provider MUST generate a different,
unique persistent identifier for the unique SPNameQualifier it receives
in the `<AuthnRequest>`.

Upon receiving an `<AttributeQuery>`, the service provider matching
service must obfuscate the received persistent identifier by applying a
hashing algorithm. The value fed into the hashing algorithm MUST be a
concatenation of the partner identifier of the identity provider (A),
the partner identifier of the entity generating the identifier (B), and
the received persistent identifier - originating from the identity
provider (C). Therefore, the following format will be used:

hash{A+B+C}

The hashing algorithm to use MUST be SHA-256.

The service providers MUST NOT locally store any persistent identifiers
from any assertions, other than the identifier that they have generated
using the above algorithm, which MUST be used when writing to the local
mapping service.

#Authentication Contexts

##Abstract

This specification defines the SAML authentication contexts to be used
in conjunction with the Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile v1.2.

##Introduction

The Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile describes how
service providers offering online government services can use any number
of Hub Services for the brokering of a citizen authentication and
enrichment of citizen attributes.

This document describes the authentication contexts to be used in
conjunction with the Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile.

###Specifying Level of Assurance in <AuthnRequest>

Service providers and the hub service will construct a
<RequestedAuthnContext> within the <AuthnRequest> that describes the
level of assurance required to enable the principal to transact with the
service.

An example <RequestedAuthnContext> can be seen below (in this case a
request for a LoA of 1 as a minimum, LoA2 preferred).

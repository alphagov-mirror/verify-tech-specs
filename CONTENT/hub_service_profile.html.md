##Introduction

The Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile describes how
service providers offering online government services can use any number
of Hub Services for the brokering of a citizen authentication and
enrichment of citizen attributes. This profile describes the
interactions between the providers, the protocol semantics and
attributes required.

The subsequent sections describe how to interpret this profile.

## Notation

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

This document describes the full SAML profile for the Identity Assurance
Hub Service including identity provider, and service provider
interactions with the hub service. For specific documentation regarding
your implementation please refer to the following sections of the
document.
##   If you are an Identity Provider please refer to section 5, Identity
    Provider Interface Specification.
##   If you are a Service Provider please refer to section 6, Service
    Provider Interface Specification.
##   If you are implementing a Matching Service (for a service provider)
    please refer to section 7, Service Provider Matching Service
    Interface Specification


##Use of Authentication Request protocol

The steps between the service provider (authentication steps), hub
service and identity provider in this profile are based on the
Authentication Request protocol defined in \[SAMLCore\]. In the
nomenclature of actors enumerated in Section 3.4 of that document, the
service provider is the request issuer and the relying party, and the
principal is the presenter, requested subject, and confirming entity.

##`<AuthnRequest>` Usage

All processing rules are as defined in \[SAMLCore\].

If the asserting entity cannot or will not satisfy the request, it MUST
respond with a `<Response>` message containing an appropriate error
status code or codes.

The `<AuthnRequest>` MUST be signed.

The `<Issuer>` element MUST be present and MUST contain the unique
identifier of the requesting entity (either a service provider or hub
service); the Format attribute MUST be omitted or have a value of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity`.

In the case of an `<AuthnRequest>` from the hub service to an IdP, the
`<RequestedAuthnContext>` element MUST be set to indicate the requested
and minimum level of assured identity the service provider requires for
this principal as provided in relying party (SP) metadata. For further
details on the valid authentication context values refer to the
accompanying document "*Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile -
Authentication Contexts v1.2*".

If the `<NameIDPolicy>` is included, then it MUST contain the Format
attribute and it MUST be set with a value of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`.

The `<Scoping>` element MUST NOT be present in the `<AuthnRequest>`
message issued by the service provider. The `<Scoping>` element MUST be
present in the `<AuthnRequest>` message issued by the hub service and
MUST have the ProxyCount attribute set to ProxyCount=0.

There will be occasions when a service provider will have no record of
the identity being asserted but may wish to create a new local 'account'
for the user in order to continue to transact. If the service provider
wishes to permit the asserting entity to establish a new identifier for
the principal if none exists, it MUST include a `<NameIDPolicy>` element
with the AllowCreate attribute set to "true". Otherwise, only a
principal for whom the asserting entity has previously established an
identifier usable by the service provider can be authenticated
successfully.

The hub service MUST specify the SPNameQualifier attribute and it MUST
have a value.

The service provider and the hub service MUST NOT include an
AssertionConsumerServiceURL attribute. Instead the service provider MAY
use the AssertionConsumerServiceIndex attribute for specifying where the
response should be sent.

The asserting entity (e.g. identity provider) MUST ensure that any
AssertionConsumerServiceIndex attribute in the request is validated
against the known range of service indexes belonging to the requesting
entity.

The service provider MAY specify the ProtocolBinding attribute and if it
does it MUST have a value of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST`.

Metadata for the service provider issuing the `<AuthnRequest>` MUST
contain at least one `<AssertionConsumingService>`. The service provider
MUST define at least one `<AssertionConsumingService>` with an attribute
isDefault set to \"true\".

If required, the service provider MAY specify an
AssertionConsumerServiceIndex attribute to override the default index.
This value MUST match a correct attribute index for that service as
defined and exchanged in metadata.

The hub service MAY define a `<Conditions>` element within the
`<AuthnRequest>` that includes a NotOnOrAfter attribute specifying time
limits on the validity of any resulting assertion within the context of
this profile. If the time window specified in any NotOnOrAfter attribute
expires the IdP MUST return a response including the status
NoAuthnContext to the hub service. This will allow the hub service to
provide assistance to the user where possible. Following a timeout the
hub service may issue a new request to the IdP with the same Request ID
as the original expired request; the IdP MUST treat this as a new
authentication request.

The IsPassive attribute MUST NOT be set.

##`<Response>` Usage

If the attesting entity wishes to return an error, it MUST NOT include
any assertions in the `<Response>` message. Otherwise if the request is
successful the `<Response>` element must conform to the following
statements:
##   The `<Issuer>` element MUST be present and it MUST contain the
    unique identifier of the issuing attesting entity. The Format
    attribute MUST be omitted or have a value of
    `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity`.
##   The `<Response>` message MUST contain at least one `<Assertion>`. An
    identity provider `<Response>` message MUST contain two
    `<Assertion>` elements.
##   The `<Response>` MUST contain an InResponseTo attribute set to the
    value contained in the original `<AuthnRequest>`.
##   Each assertion MUST contain a `<Subject>` element with at least one
    `<SubjectConfirmation>` element containing a Method of
    `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer`.
##   Each assertion MUST contain a `<NameID>` element. The Format MUST be
    set to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`.
##   The bearer `<SubjectConfirmation>` element for the assertion
    described above MUST contain a `<SubjectConfirmationData>` element.
    Within the `<SubjectConfirmationData>` element, the Recipient MUST
    contain the value from `<Issuer>` in the associated
    `<AuthnRequest>`, as well as the NotOnOrAfter attribute that limits
    the window during which the assertion can be delivered. It MAY
    contain an Address attribute limiting the client address from which
    the assertion can be delivered. It MUST NOT contain a NotBefore
    attribute. The InResponseTo attribute MUST be provided and match the
    `<AuthnRequest>` ID.
##   The bearer assertion MUST NOT contain an `<AudienceRestriction>`.
##   The assertion containing the matching data MUST contain an
    `<AuthnStatement>` that reflects the level of assurance (LoA) being
    asserted by the identity provider. No other `<AuthnStatement>`
    should be provided in the authentication context associated with the
    matching data assertion.
##   The assertion containing contextual information related to the
    authentication event MUST contain at least one `<AuthnStatement>`
    that reflects the authentication of the principal to the attesting
    entity.
##   The assertion containing contextual information related to the
    authentication event MUST contain at least one `<SubjectLocality>`
    element containing the DNS name and the IP address of the system
    from which the SAML subject was authenticated[^10].
##   The `<AuthnStatement>` MUST contain an `<AuthnContext>` element
    which itself MUST contain an `<AuthnContextClassRef>` element with
    one of the SAML 2.0 defined authentication context classes.
##   The assertion containing matching data MUST contain an
    `<AttributeStatement>` with at least one `<Attribute>` element. For
    requests that have included attribute enrichment, the `<Attribute>`
    and `<AttributeValue>` elements MUST contain the service provider
    specific identifier for the principal. For requests that have not
    included attribute enrichment, the `<Attribute>` and
    `<AttributeValue>` elements MUST contain the matching dataset
    attributes. A full definition of SAML Attributes relating to this
    SAML Profile can be found in *"Identity Assurance Hub Service
    Profile - SAML Attributes v1.2"*.
##   The entire assertion MUST be encrypted for the hub. This is the case
    for all assertions to the hub.
##   Where a NotOnOrAfter attribute is specified in the `<Conditions>`
    element provided in the `<AuthnRequest>`, validity of the assertion
    MUST be limited accordingly.
##   Other conditions MAY be included as requested by the service
    provider, the hub service, or at the discretion of the attesting
    entity. (Of course, all such conditions MUST be understood by and
    accepted by the service provider in order for the assertion to be
    considered valid.) The attesting entity is not obligated to honour
    the requested set of `<Conditions>` in the `<AuthnRequest>`, if
    any.[^11]

Where the attesting entity wishes to return an error, it MUST NOT
include any assertions of identity in the `<Response>` message. An
Identity Provider MUST return an authentication event assertion where
this is available regardless of the error condition. Details of the
error must be ret`urned` in the form of a status code and any associated
sub-status code as specified in the relevant process step.

##`<Response>` Message Processing Rules

The service provider MUST process the `<Response>` message and the
enclosed `<Assertion>` element as described in \[SAMLCore\] and
\[SAMLProfile\].

##POST-Specific Processing Rules

    The service provider and the hub service MUST ensure that bearer
    assertions are not replayed, by maintaining the set of used ID
    values for the length of time for which the assertion would be
    considered valid based on the NotOnOrAfter attribute in the
    `<SubjectConfirmationData>`.

<!-- -->

##Unsolicited Responses

    An attesting entity MUST NOT initiate this profile by delivering an
    unsolicited `<Response>` message to a service provider.

##Use of Attribute Query protocol

The steps between the hub service and matching service in this profile
are based on the Assertion Query and Request Protocol, specifically, the
AttributeQuery definition within \[SAMLCore\].

##`<AttributeQuery>` Usage

All processing rules are as defined in \[SAMLCore\].

The `<AttributeQuery>` message MUST be signed by the hub service and
MUST contain the `<Issuer>` element.

The ID attribute in the `<AttributeQuery>` MUST be set to the same value
as the ID attribute from the original `<AuthnRequest>`

The message MUST contain one `<NameID>` element of type PrincipalIDType
as defined in section 3.1

The synchronous SOAP binding MUST be used to send the `<AttributeQuery>`
request.

##`<AttributeQuery>` Processing Rules

    The service provider matching service SHOULD use its local identity
    mapping service first to determine if it already has a match for the
    principal based on the existence of the locally generated version of
    Identifier (based on the identifier in the `<AttributeQuery>`)
    mapped to a local identity. If an entry exists, then the service
    provider matching service SHOULD NOT execute a new identity match
    for that principal.

    If no entry exists in the identity mapping service for the
    locally-generated Identifier, the service provider matching service
    MUST attempt to uniquely match the principal in the request to a
    uniquely identified local principal. All of the values within the
    assertions received from the hub service MAY be used for this
    purpose.

    Upon finding a unique match, the service provider matching service
    SHOULD store a mapping between the locally-generated Identifier
    value and the local unique identifier for that principal.

    If no unique match is found, the service provider matching service
    SHOULD identify, from the list of results, which additional
    attributes would enable a unique match to be made. The service
    provider matching service MUST return a `<Response>` message to the
    hub service containing an error and MAY contain the list of required
    attributes. Any required attributes contained in the `<Response>`
    MUST be a subset of the matching process attributes contained in the
    provider's metadata already exchanged with the hub service. See
    section 2.1.3.16.1 for a list of status codes to use.[^12]

    The service provider matching service MUST validate that the
    InResponseTo attribute values of all of the signed assertions in the
    `<AttributeQuery>` to ensure they match the ID value of the
    `<AttributeQuery>`. An error MUST be generated where this validation
    fails and the authentication forced to fail. It should be noted that
    the most likely cause of this error will be an attack on the
    matching service.

##Attribute Query `<Response>` Usage

    The service provider matching service MUST return a response to the
    hub service.

The `<Response>` MUST contain an InResponseTo attribute set to the ID
value contained in the original `<AttributeQuery>`.

The `<Response>` MUST include a copy of the `<AuthnContext>` as provided
in the IDP authentication event assertion `<AuthnStatement>`. This
information will allow the service to act upon the level of assurance
reached by the principal during authentication if this has not met the
minimum required level.

The `<Response>` message and `<Assertion>` MUST be signed. The
`<Assertion>` MUST be encrypted for the hub service by the service
provider matching service after it is signed.

##Federation Termination

In this scenario, the principal is provided with the ability to remove
the stored link between their identity at an identity provider and their
identity at a service provider. This would force matching to re-occur
the next time the principal attempted to access a protected service at
the service provider.

It should be noted that this scenario does not prevent the principal
from authenticating at an identity provider and accessing protected
services. Instead it is designed to remove the existing link between the
principal's identities at the two entities.

To simplify the design, a pragmatic approach was taken to implementing
federation termination. As a result the hub service profile does not
define a flow based on SAML 2.0 Name Identifier Management Profile.

Instead, the hub service profile RECOMMENDS that service providers
SHOULD provide an administrative function that allows an administrator
to remove the PersistentID\<-\>LocalID mapping within the local mapping
service in the service provider.

Furthermore, processes SHOULD be implemented at the service provider to
enable a principal to request that this mapping is removed from the
mapping service.

##Status Code Usage

The IDA SAML Profile describes a number of situations where status codes
are required to be ret`urned` to the hub service to describe the
occurrence of specific events.

All status codes MUST be ret`urned` in the SAML `<Response>` element as
one or more nested `<StatusCode>` elements. SAML Core specifies 4
top-level status codes that can be ret`urned` and a range of subordinate
status codes that can be ret`urned` beneath the top-level status code.

For example, the IDA SAML Profile states that when a principal cancels
an authentication at the IDP the IDP should respond with a status code
of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoAuthnContext` (see section
2.1.3.5.1). This would result in the following `<Status>` element in the
IDP `<Response>`:

> \<saml:Status\>\
> \<saml:StatusCode
> Value=\"`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder`\"\>\
> \<saml:StatusCode
> Value=\"`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoAuthnContext`\"/\>\
> \</saml:StatusCode\>
>
> \</saml:Status\>

Any status codes MUST be ret`urned` as specified in SAML Core with the
status code values as specified in the IDA SAML Profile for a particular
event.

#Name Identifiers

This section details the policy for use and creation of persistent
identifiers by the service provider matching services.

##Persistent Identifier

**URI:** `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML2.0:nameid-format:persistent`

This identifier is used between the hub and identity provider, and the
hub and service provider. It conforms to the \[SAMLCore\] specification
for persistent name identifiers.

The persistent identifier MUST be generated in conformance to
\[SAMLCore\] by the identity provider and included in the assertion for
a given principal. The identity provider SHOULD ensure that the
persistent identifier is valid for an extended period of time, e.g.
several months to avoid unnecessary re-matching occurring.

To ensure privacy of the principal is maintained across providers, the
persistent identifier stored for the same principal MUST be unique
between each of the following entities:
##   Identity Provider
##   Service Provider

In order to ensure uniqueness of the persistent identifier and to ensure
no identifiers are stored within the hub service, an algorithm will be
used for generation of the persistent identifier. This will be
implemented within every service provider (within the service provider
matching service.)

For a single principal, the identity provider MUST generate a different,
unique persistent identifier for the unique SPNameQualifier it receives
in the `<AuthnRequest>`.

Upon receiving an `<AttributeQuery>`, the service provider matching
service must obfuscate the received persistent identifier by applying a
hashing algorithm. The value fed into the hashing algorithm MUST be a
concatenation of the partner identifier of the identity provider (A),
the partner identifier of the entity generating the identifier (B), and
the received persistent identifier - originating from the identity
provider (C). Therefore, the following format will be used:

hash{A+B+C}

The hashing algorithm to use MUST be SHA-256.

The service providers MUST NOT locally store any persistent identifiers
from any assertions, other than the identifier that they have generated
using the above algorithm, which MUST be used when writing to the local
mapping service.

    server-side certificates to ensure the confidentiality and integrity
    of all messages is maintained during transport.

#IDP Specific Profile Steps

###Overview

Identity Providers (IDPs) interact with a single service provider, the
IDA hub service, which acts as a federation hub between the service
wishing to complete a transaction (the service provider, SP, in the
figure 2 below), and the identity provider itself.

Principals are directed to the identity provider (from the hub service)
via the user agent with an `<AuthnRequest>` describing the level of
assurance required by the relying party.

On receipt of the `<AuthnRequest>` the identity provider follows the
process steps described below in order to attempt authentication of the
principal at the requested level of assurance. Identity providers are
free to perform registration as part of this process if required but
this is not described in this profile.

Figure 2 -- Identity Provider Authentication Flow

##Profile steps

The following profile steps are taken from the full authentication flow
described in section 2.1 of this document. Step numbers have been
retained to match the full process flow. The steps relating to an
identity provider are shown in Figure 2 above.

###`<AuthnRequest>` issued by Hub Service to the Identity Provider

In step 6, the location of the identity provider\'s single sign-on
service is retrieved from the identity provider's metadata and a new
`<AuthnRequest>` message is produced and delivered to the identity
provider via the user agent using HTTP-POST.

The `<AuthnRequest>` message MUST be signed by the hub service and MUST
define any specific elements that were included in the `<AuthnRequest>`
it received from the service provider, such as ForceAuthn.

The value of `<ID>` within the `<AuthnRequest>` MUST be set to the same
value as the ID from the original `<AuthnRequest>` received from the
service provider. The value of `<ID>` MUST NOT reveal the source of the
request or the type of service operated by the requestor.

Within the `<AuthnRequest>`, the Format attribute within
`<NameIDPolicy>` MUST be set to
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` and SPNameQualifier
MUST be set to a value representing the overall hub services.

The hub service MUST NOT pass the RelayState received from the service
provider to the identity provider.

Where the principal has explicitly selected to Register rather than
Sign-In with an Identity Provider the hub service SHOULD append an
additional parameter to the HTTP-POST binding of registration=true. This
parameter alerts the Identity Provider to the principal's intention
allowing for the optional delivery of a more appropriate user
experience.

###Identity Provider successfully identifies Principal

    In step 7, the identity provider identifies the principal by some
    means outside the scope of this profile. This may require a new act
    of authentication, or it may reuse an existing authenticated
    session.

The identity provider MUST establish the identity of the principal or
return an error to the hub service (see following sub-sections for
details of error types). The ForceAuthn attribute, if present with a
value of true, obligates the identity provider to freshly establish this
identity, rather than relying on an existing session it may have with
the principal. Otherwise the identity provider may use any means to
authenticate the user as dictated by standards (e.g. GPG 44 / 45),
subject to any requirements included in the `<AuthnRequest>` and
specifically the `<RequestedAuthnContext>` element.

###Error Case: Principal fails authentication with Identity Provider

At this point in the flow, the principal may fail to successfully
authenticate to the identity provider. For example, if the principal
enters incorrect credentials beyond the maximum number of attempts
permitted.

If the principal fails to authenticate then the identity provider MUST
generate a `<Response>` containing a status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder` with a sub-status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:AuthnFailed`.

It is recognised that additional error codes will be required as
dictated by user experience research. These additional error codes will
appear in future iterations of the SAML profile.

###Error Case: Principal fails authentication at the appropriate level with Identity Provider

At this point in the flow the identity provider may be unable to
authenticate the user to the level specified in the
`<RequestedAuthnContext>` within the `<AuthnRequest>`. For example, this
could be because the principal doesn\'t have an account with the
identity provider or that the principal doesn\'t have an account that
can authenticate to the required level.

If this occurs then the identity provider MUST generate a `<Response>`
containing a status code of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder`
with a sub-status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoAuthnContext`.

In the event of an error case, the identity provider MUST also display
an explanation message to the principal before issuing the response to
the hub service. The contents of this message is implementation
dependent but should explain to the principal, why they are being sent
back to the hub service.

###Alternate Flow: Principal cancels authentication attempt

At this point in the flow, the principal may indicate (for example by
selecting a cancel button available on the identity provider login page)
that they do not wish to proceed with the authentication operation.

If this occurs then the identity provider MUST generate a `<Response>`
containing a status code of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder`
with a sub-status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoAuthnContext` and MUST include a
`<StatusDetail>` element containing a `<StatusValue>` element with the
value authn-cancel.

###Alternate Flow: Principal unable to reach appropriate level at this time with Identity Provider -- Pending State

In this case the principal is able to authenticate with the identity
provider but not at the level of assurance requested by the hub service
due to a system failure out of control of the principal or due to a
step-out process during identity verification and proofing.

If this occurs an identity provider MUST generate a `<Response>`
containing a status code of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder`
with a sub-status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoAuthnContext` and MUST include a
`<StatusDetail>` element containing a `<StatusValue>` element with the
value loa-pending.

###Identity Provider issues `<Response>` to Hub Service

In step 8, the identity provider issues a `<Response>` message delivered
via the user agent to the hub service. The message MUST contain either
an error or an authentication assertion.

Regardless of the success or failure of the authentication process, the
identity provider MUST produce a HTTP response to the user agent
containing a `<Response>` message that is delivered to the hub service's
assertion consumer service.

The location of the assertion consumer service MUST be one of the
services registered in the metadata (as in \[SAMLMeta\]). A hub service
MAY indicate the specific assertion consumer service index to use in its
`<AuthnRequest>` and the identity provider MUST honour this if set and
valid.

The `<Response>` element and any `<Assertion>` element in the
`<Response>` MUST be signed. The assertion MUST be encrypted for the hub
service after it has been signed.

There will be 2 `<Assertion>` elements sent from the IDP to the hub
service via the user agent for a successful authentication event: one
assertion containing the Matching DataSet (MDS), and one containing
contextual information related to the authentication event. The
assertion containing the authentication event will also include the
`<AuthnContext>` element. The contextual information may include data
items such as level of authentication, authentication type, and IP
address. In version 1.2 this information will initially comprise of IP
Address and LoA[^14]. A full definition of SAML Attributes relating to
this SAML Profile can be found in *"Identity Assurance Hub Service
Profile - SAML Attributes v1.2"*.

In the case of a fraud event being identified the Identity Provider MUST
return a Fraud Event Response as described in 5.2.3.1 below.

On redirection to the hub service the Identity Provider MUST close any
authentication session that has been created.[^15]

###Fraud Event Response: Identity Provider identifies actual or potentially fraudulent activity

Notification of a fraud event to the hub service by an identity provider
MUST be via a SAML `<Response>` using the same basic pattern as for a
normal identity provider `<Response>` to an authentication request.

In the case of a fraud event notification the payload of the 2
`<Assertion>` elements required in an identity provider `<Response>`
will vary from the normal authentication `<Response>` message by
describing the fraud event rather than an assertion of identity[^16].

Where a fraud has been detected by the Identity Provider during the
registration process, the Identity Provider MUST issue a `<Response>` to
the hub service which includes a fraud event identity assertion and a
fraud event contextual information assertion. These assertions are
issued using the same `<Response>` pattern as for a normal
authentication response but MUST include a specific fraud event related
payload in the assertions.

The fraud event identity assertion MUST include the following elements:

-   The assertion MUST contain a `<NameID>` element. The Format MUST be
    set to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`. The
    value of this element MUST be the persistent identifier (PID)
    associated with the principal.
-   A Matching Data Set attribute statement that MUST contain dummy or
    anonymous values as placeholders. This is to prevent statistical
    analysis of the assertion payload.

The fraud event contextual information assertion MUST include the
following elements:

-   An `<AttributeStatement>` for the fraud event:
  -  Where a contra-indicator has been identified according to GPG45
     the corresponding GPG45 status code MUST be included as an
     attribute value
  -  An attribute MUST be included denoting the unique IDP specific
     fraud event reference code. This attribute value MUST be derived
     from the IDP name, a date-time stamp, and a sequence number for
     the event.
-   An `<AuthnContext>` that MUST include an `<AuthnContextClassRef>`
    denoting a fraud event, and the fact that a level of assurance has
    not been achieved, with the value of
    `urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:authn-context:levelX`

The `<Response>` MUST contain an InResponseTo attribute set to the value
contained in the original `<AuthnRequest>`.

The `<Response>` MUST contain a status code of value
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success`[^17].

A full definition of SAML Attributes relating to this SAML Profile can
be found in *"Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile - SAML Attributes
v1.2"*.

#Service Provider Specific Profile Steps

###Overview

Service Providers will interact with a single logical identity provider
in the form of the hub service. When the service provider wishes to
authenticate an individual an `<AuthnRequest>` will be constructed by
the service provider and sent to the hub service's identity provider
interface.

The hub service will orchestrate the authentication process resulting in
a `<Response>` being sent to the requesting service provider.

Service providers will also need to specify a Service Provider Matching
Service (see section 7) to complete the identification of an individual.

Figure 3 -- Service Provider Authentication Flow

##Profile steps

The following profile steps are taken from the full authentication flow
described in section 2.1 of this document. Step numbers have been
retained to match the full process flow. The steps relating to a service
provider are shown in Figure 3 above.

##HTTP Resource Request to Service Provider

In step 1, the principal, via a HTTP User Agent, makes a HTTP request
for a secured resource at service provider without a security context.

The service provider is free to use any means it wishes to associate the
subsequent interactions with the original request. SAML provides a
RelayState mechanism that a service provider MAY use to associate the
profile exchange with the original request. The service provider MUST
reveal as little of the request as possible in the RelayState value.

##Service Provider Determines Hub Service

In step 2, the service provider determines which hub service to use to
broker the authentication request.[^18]

This step is implementation-dependent. The hub service uri for
authentication requests will be supplied by the hub service itself.
There will only be a logical instance of the hub service.

##`<AuthnRequest>` issued by Service Provider Hub Service

In step 3, an `<AuthnRequest>` message is delivered to the hub service's
single sign-on service by the user agent. See 2.1.3.2. above for
discovery of the hub service's single sign-on service.

The `<AuthnRequest>` message MUST be signed.

See section 4 for a list of SAML profiles and bindings that MUST be
supported.

##Hub Service issues `<Response>` to Service Provider

In step 26, the hub service issues a `<Response>` message delivered by
the user agent to the service provider. The response message MUST
contain an error in the form of a status code (and any relevant
sub-status code), OR contain an authentication assertion.

Regardless of the success or failure of the `<AuthnRequest>`, the hub
service MUST produce a HTTP response to the user agent containing a
`<Response>` message which is delivered to the service provider\'s
assertion consumer service.

The location of the assertion consumer service MAY be determined using
metadata (as in \[SAMLMeta\]). In its `<AuthnRequest>`, a service
provider MAY indicate the specific assertion consumer service to use and
the hub service SHOULD honour it if it can.

The `<Response>` element MUST be signed. The `<Assertion>` element will
already be signed by the service provider matching service. To ensure
that the assertion is for the specific target SP the `<Assertion>` must
also be encrypted by the hub service after it is signed using the
service provider's public key.

##Service Provider grants or denies access to Principal

In step 27, having received the response from the hub service, the
service provider processes the `<Response>` and `<Assertion>` and grants
or denies access to the resource. The service provider MAY establish a
security context with the user agent using any session mechanism it
chooses. Any subsequent use of the `<Assertion>` provided is at the
discretion of the service provider and other relying parties, subject to
restrictions on use contained within it.

The service provider MAY respond to the principal's user agent with its
own error if it fails to establish a security context for the principal.

The service provider MUST process the `<Response>` message and the
enclosed `<Assertion>` element as described in \[SAMLCore\].

#Service Provider Matching Service Specific Profile Steps

###Overview

Service Provider Matching Services respond to matching requests from the
hub service in the form of an `<AttributeQuery>`.

Matching services act on behalf of a service provider to obtain a match
to a local identifier relevant to the service provider and enabling it
to complete a transaction for the principal.

![](media/image5.jpg){width="6.497222222222222in"
height="3.6105260279965004in"}

Figure 4 -- Service Provider Matching Service Authentication Flow

##Profile steps

The following profile steps are taken from the full authentication flow
described in section 2.1 of this document. Step numbers have been
retained to match the full process flow. The steps relating to a service
provider matching service are shown in Figure 4 above.

##`<AttributeQuery>` issued by Hub Service to Matching Service

To enable a service provider to obtain a match to a local identifier the
`<AttributeQuery>` construct is used to initiate a local matching
process. In step 20, the location of the service provider\'s matching
service is determined via metadata and the hub service delivers an
`<AttributeQuery>` message to the matching service using the SAML SOAP
binding.

This step MUST include an `<AttributeQuery>` message sent to the
matching service of the original request\'s service provider to enable
the matching process to be executed.

The value of the ID attribute within the `<AttributeQuery>` MUST be the
same as the value of the ID attribute contained in the original
`<AuthnRequest>` from the service provider.

The `<AttributeQuery>` message MUST be signed.

The request will contain a single `<SubjectConfirmationData>` element
within `<SubjectConfirmation>`. This MUST contain one or more Assertions
for each assertion that the service provider needs.

At a minimum the `<AttributeQuery>` MUST contain the identity provider
assertion.

The value of NameID contained with the `<AttributeQuery>` MUST be the
PersistentID extracted from the identity provider assertion

The `<Assertion>` element containing the identity provider assertion for
the principal MUST be included in the attribute query and it MUST be
encrypted for the matching service. This identity provider assertion
MUST include the original signature from the identity provider.

The hub service MUST use the synchronous SAML SOAP binding and MUST
authenticate itself to the service provider by signing the message.

##Matching Service generates Persistent Identifier

In step 21, the matching service will hash the PersistentID in order to
generate a persistent identifier to optimise subsequent matching and
lookup. This identifier will be used to lookup the local identifier in
the local mapping service and will be used in the `<Response>` to the
hub service.

The non-hashed PersistentID SHOULD NOT be stored.

This locally generated PersistentID is mathematically derived from the
PersistentID contained in the identity provider assertion. The
PersistentID MUST be generated in accordance with the details provided
in section 3.1.

##Matching Service matches Name Identifier

In step 22, the service provider matching service attempts to uniquely
match the principal contained in the identity provider assertion (and
optionally hub service assertions) sent from the hub service in the
`<AttributeQuery>` message, with a principal in the service provider.

Using the attributes provided in the identity provider assertion, the
service provider matching service MUST attempt to match the name
identifier against previously matched principals contained in its local
mapping service. If a previous match does not exist the service provider
matching service MUST attempt to match the principal to a principal for
which it holds attributes (i.e. a local identifier recognised by the
service provider).

The service provider matching service MAY decide whether to use any
user-entered attributes contained in the signed hub service assertion
and the level of trust it places on those values.

The details of the steps taken to perform the match against the local
identity repository are implementation dependent.

If a previous match exists (i.e. there is a match of principal to
persistent identifier a the matching service), then a `<Response>`
containing a status code of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success`
and a sub-status code of
`urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:statuscode:match` MUST be ret`urned`.

If a match to persistent identifier cannot be achieved the matching
service MUST attempt to match the principal to a local identifier using
the provided matching data set (MDS). Where a match is achieved a
correlation between the name identifier and a local identity for the
principal SHOULD be maintained (see 7.2.4).

The matching service MUST process the `<AttributeQuery>` message as
defined in \[SAMLCore\].

The details of the steps taken to perform the match against the local
identity repository are implementation dependent.

##Error Case: Matching Service Fails to Uniquely Match Principal

There are a number of status codes that MAY be generated during the
match process. The first failure scenario during the match is when the
matching service is unable to uniquely match the principal to a local
identity. In this scenario, the matching service may either have no
matches for the principal or multiple matches.

Where the matching service has found no matches for the principal, then
it MUST return a `<Response>` containing a status code
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder` and a sub-status code of
`urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:statuscode:no-match`.

Where the matching service has found multiple matches for the principal,
then it MUST return a `<Response>` containing a status code
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder` and a sub-status code of
`urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:statuscode:multiple-match`.

The second failure scenario during the match is when the matching
service is unable to uniquely match the name identifier to a local
identity but determines that no further matching is required.

Where the matching service has found no match for the principal but does
not require further matching, then it MUST return a `<Response>`
containing a status code `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success` and
a sub-status code of
`urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:statuscode:no-match`.

##Matching Service updates local mapping service

In step 23, the matching service MUST update its local mapping service
to store the link between the locally generated PersistentID generated
in 2.1.3.21 and the local identifier for that principal.

If the matching service matches the principal contained in the
`<AttributeQuery>` name identifier to a local identity, then the mapping
service MUST store the link between the locally generated PersistentID
and the local identifier for that principal. The matching service MUST
NOT store any of the persistent identifiers contained in the inbound
`<AttributeQuery>`.

If the matching service is unable to match the name identifier to a
local identity, through any of the configured data match escalations
then an entry COULD be written into the mapping service containing a
link between the locally generated PersistentID generated in 2.1.3.21
and a local, temporary identifier. This is to enable local account
mapping within the service provider as well as avoid the need for the
matching service to perform a match each time a request is received for
a ret`urning` principal.

The details of how the matching service updates its local mapping
service is implemented are implementation dependent. However, the
recommended approach is that the matching service SHOULD maintain a
correlation between the name identifier (persistent identifier) and a
local identity (local identifier) as part of the matching process (i.e.
when a match is achieved), resulting in a mapping table that could be
used by the service provider during its principal lookup.

The details of how the local, temporary identifier are generated and
updated are outside the scope of this specification and are
implementation dependent.

##Matching Service extracts required attributes

In step 24, the matching service MUST extract any provided attribute
values from the assertions contained in the `<AttributeQuery>` from the
hub service.

##Matching Service issues `<Response>` message to the Hub Service

In step 25, the matching service issues a `<Response>` message to the
hub service.

The `<Response>` message must contain a name identifier of type
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` and contain the
value for locally generated persistent identifier generated in step
2.1.3.21.

In addition the status code MUST contain one of the status codes and
sub-status codes defined in 2.1.3.22.1 or contain a status code of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success` and a sub-status code of
`urn:uk:gov:cabinet-office:tc:saml:statuscode:match`.

The `<Response>` MUST contain all attributes extracted in 2.1.3.24,
defined as standard SAML `<Attribute>`.

The `<Response>` MUST include a copy of the `<AuthnContext>` as provided
in the IDP authentication event assertion `<AuthnStatement>`. This
information will allow the service to act upon the level of assurance
reached by the principal during authentication if this has not met the
minimum required level.

The `<Response>` and `<Assertion>` must be signed. The `<Assertion>`
contained in the response MUST also be encrypted for the hub service
after it is signed.

The matching service MUST authenticate itself to the requester by
signing the `<Response>`.

#Metadata Requirements

##Service Provider and Matching Service Metadata

###SAML Metadata

Service Providers and matching services will be required to provide
content equivalent to standard SAML metadata elements to describe the
keys, endpoints and contact details required by their services and for
operation with the hub service. This metadata SHOULD be provided out of
band via methods described in the GOV.UK Verify on-boarding guide.

Service Provider Metadata will include keys, endpoints and contact
elements defined in standard SAML metadata.

###Additional Metadata

Service Providers MUST provide additional metadata required for
connection to the hub service including Level of Assurance requirements,
and matching requirements (endpoints and process steps).

This additional service provider metadata will be gathered out-of-band
and will be specified in the GOV.UK Verify on-boarding guide.

##IDP Metadata

###SAML Metadata

Identity Providers will be required to provide content equivalent to
standard SAML metadata elements to describe the keys, endpoints and
contact details required for operation with the hub service. This
metadata SHOULD be provided out of band via methods described in the
GOV.UK Verify IDP on-boarding documentation.

Identity Provider Metadata will include keys, endpoints and contact
elements defined in standard SAML metadata.

###Additional Metadata

Identity Providers MUST provide additional metadata required for
connection to the hub service such as user interface elements and
instructional text for the hub IDP selection process.

This additional identity provider metadata will be gathered out-of-band
and will be specified in the GOV.UK Verify on-boarding guide.

##Federation Metadata

The hub service MUST host a SAML metadata document, known as the
federation metadata, that describes the identity providers and the hub
service as SAML entities using `<EntityDescriptor>` elements.

The hub service MUST be described using a `<SPSSODescriptor>` with its
signing and encryption certificates described in `<KeyDescriptor>`
elements.

Each identity provider MUST be described using a `<IDPSSODescriptor>`
with its signing certificate described in a `<KeyDescriptor>` element.

All service providers, matching services, identity providers, and the
hub service MUST regularly consume the federation metadata so that they
have up to date metadata for the entities that they communicate with.

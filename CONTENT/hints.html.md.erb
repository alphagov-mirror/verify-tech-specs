##Introduction

The Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML v2.0 Profile describes how
service providers offering online government services can use any number
of Hub Services for the brokering of a citizen authentication and
enrichment of citizen attributes.

Within the profile, users move from one system to another bearing SAML
messages which typically contain either requests for authentication or
the results of an authentication attempt.

This document describes a mechanism known as “hints” which allows
additional information to be passed alongside the SAML messages in order
to improve the user interface that a user will see on the next hop of
their journey.

##Hints

When a user posts a form generated by a source site A to a destination
site B as part of the flow described in the profile, site A MAY include
form parameters to allow site B to present a suitable user interface.

###Language Hint

Purpose: To ensure the user can continue to interact using their
preferred language on the destination site

Generated by: SPs, Hub and IDPs.

Consumed by: SPs, Hub and IDPs

The form parameter MUST be named “language”. Its value MUST be an
ISO639-1 language code, such as “en”.

###Registration Hint

Purpose: To ensure that if the user has indicated to Hub that they are a
new user, options to register are shown prominently at the IDP

Generated by: Hub

Consumed by: IDPs

The form parameter MUST be named “registration”. Allowed values:

true - user wishes to register

false - user wishes to sign in

###Evidence and Capability Hints

Purpose: To ensure that where users indicate to Hub which evidence and
capabilities they are able and willing to use, IDPs provide appropriate
user journeys

Generated by: Hub

Consumed by: IDPs

The form parameter MUST be named “hint” and MAY be multi-valued (i.e.
multiple input elements with name=”hint” with different values in a
single form submission).

In order for hub to inform an IDP that a user has a hypothetical
capability or possesses a piece of evidence xyz, hub sends a value as
follows:

hint=has\_xyz

If the user does NOT have that capability, hub sends:

hint=not\_xyz

Evidence and capability hints are only sent by Hub when the user
indicated that they are a new user.

###Journey Hints

Purpose: To ensure that when a user needs to be re-authenticated shortly
after an initial authentication, a simplified hub journey can be
presented to the user.

Generated by: SPs

Consumed by: Hub

The form parameter MUST be named “journey\_hint”.

##Conformance

###All hints

IDPs MUST NOT rely on the presence of particular hints from the hub to
complete the identity proofing and verification process for an
individual - the journey MUST work with or without hints.

IDPs MUST ignore unknown hint values, i.e. IDPs should treat an unknown
hint as if the hint were not provided

IDPs MAY store hint values past the end of the session in an analytics
system for the purposes of improving their service, so long as the data
is not stored linked to individual user accounts.

IDPs MUST NOT use or analyse hints for any purpose other than to improve
their service, nor derive nor infer any information from hints to be
used for any other purpose.

###Language hint

If the user has explicitly chosen a language while interacting with a
federation member, that party SHOULD provide the language as a hint when
sending the user to the next party in the federation.

If this hint is present, the destination site SHOULD display its user
interface in the specified language. If the specified language is not
available, the site MUST show its user interface in an alternate
language.

###Registration hint

The IDP MUST make both registration and sign in flows available to the
user, regardless of the hint value received. The IDP SHOULD prioritise
registration or sign in depending on the value of the hint

If the IDP receives an empty or invalid value for this hint, the IDP
SHOULD show options for both sign in and registration.
